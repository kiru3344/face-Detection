# face-Detection
This project is a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV. It loads a dataset of face images per person, trains an LBPH recognizer, and uses a webcam to detect and identify faces. Detected faces are labeled with names and confidence or marked "Unknown," with live rectangles and labels on the video feed.
